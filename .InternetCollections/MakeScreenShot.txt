The best documentation for this I've found is for the WebDriver module
In there there's a description of makeScreenshot() which allows you to 
take a screen shot at any given point of your tests. It appears that it 
will put all of the screen shots in one directory so better think about 
a good naming convention.
Alternatively, we've now got the Recorder extension working which 
automates the process of taking screen shots at every test step and 
presents them in a useful report.

``` php
<?php
$I->amOnPage('/user/edit');
$I->makeScreenshot('edit_page');
// saved to: tests/_output/debug/edit_page.png
?>
```
