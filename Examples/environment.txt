Make sure that your codeception version is at least 1.8, as environment is only supported from 1.8.

Below is our setup for codeception, specified in api.suite.yml, with PhpBrowser and REST modules enabled for BDD and API testings:

...
env:
    local:
        modules:
            config:
                PhpBrowser:
                    url: http://local.example.com/
                REST:
                    url: http://local.example.com/v1/
    integration:
        modules:
            config:
                PhpBrowser:
                    url: http://integration.example.com/
                REST:
                    url: http://integration.example.com/v1/
    staging:
        modules:
            config:
                PhpBrowser:
                    url: http://staging.example.com/
                REST:
                    url: http://staging.example.com/v1/

When running codecept command, you need to provide an --env option to specify which environment the tests should use.
