I am working on something similar, but on Windows. Right now I have installed Codeception as global using Composer:

composer global require "codeception/codeception=2.0.*"
composer global require "codeception/specify=*"
composer global require "codeception/verify=*"

This allows me to switch to a specific folder like yours "/Module1/Applications/" and then issue the commands directly, e.g.:

a) set up the test directory:

codecept bootstrap

b) create the tests by:

codecept generate:cept functional AccountType1Cept

If you prefer, you can do it from the main directory, but you have first to tell Codeception the name, then use the "-c" option to indicate that you want to execute the command in the directory that follows, and then the target directory. In your case (using Linux) it would be:

codecept.phar generate:cept functional AccountType1Cept -c ~/Module1/Applications 

but for me it's too much typing, it's easier to just switch to the target folder and issue all the commands there :-)
